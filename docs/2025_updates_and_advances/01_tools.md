# Tools used for the 2025 update

This workshop uses Jupyter Notebooks, Napari, Cellpose, Stardist and Microsam among other tools.  In addition the following other projects are used.

[tnia-python](https://github.com/True-North-Intelligent-Algorithms/tnia-python) - This is a general utility project for image processing including deep learning utilities.

[easy-augment-batch-dl](https://github.com/True-North-Intelligent-Algorithms/napari-easy-augment-batch-dl) A plugin to perform deep learning on small to medium sized image sets with UNETs, Cellpose, Stardist, SAM and friends.  In particular this plugin is useful for performing deep learning with a small number of labels and augmentation, and experimenting with different deep learning frameworks.  

[napari-ai-lab](https://github.com/True-North-Intelligent-Algorithms/napari-ai-lab) A collection of plugins and utilities for ND segmentation with Cellpose, StarDist, SAM and more.  The motivation for this newer project is to construct a better base to handle ND datasets and complicated dependency handling (vie Appose and Pixi)

## Some examples may be 'under construction'
