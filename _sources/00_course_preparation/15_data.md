# Code and Data  

The code for this workshop can be found [here](https://github.com/True-North-Intelligent-Algorithms/notebooks-and-napari-widgets-for-dl)

Data can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/4lvuwq8pbdx0ubba9ey85/AMz_dint2PkRASM1oFWx6uA?rlkey=4ibypc0u40ub702trdipzokir%26st=spgp9ckc%26dl=0)

If above link does not work (it seems like the ampersand is causing problems in some browsers try this link)

As well here is the data link in full (perhaps it is the markdown mangling it)

Place the data in the code directory, that is directly under the ```notebooks-and-napari-widgets-for-dl``` from github.
