## Segment Everything with SAM

In this section we

1.  Use Napari to visualize the overlapping labels generated by SAM
2.  Filter the (potentially) hundreds or thousands of labels generated by SAM


### What is SAM ? 

SAM stands for Segment Anything Model.  SAM is a prompt based generalist image segmentation system.  A prompt is a hint as to what object(s) to segment.  A prompt can be a point (click on an object), a bounding box, or even a pixel mask (first guess segmentation).  

The input to sam is a prompt and an image and the output is a pixel mask.  There are many variations of SAM.  [Mobile SAM](https://github.com/ChaoningZhang/MobileSAM) for example uses a custom YOLO detector to generate a bounding boxes prompt.    

SAM is very good at detecting overlapping objects (think spots on the lady-bugs).  We can give SAM multiple prompts and it will return multiple segmentation masks.  If we want a conventional '2D' segmentation we have to transform the mask collection to a 2D image (for example by projecting).
